 Calculates the chance for k sequential rolls in N rolls. 
 
 Usage: Run the script and follow the prompts in CLI
 
  MCM - MonteCarlo Method - Basically just doing a ton of runs with the RNG and tallying up the results
  
  BruteForce - Generates ALL possible outcomes and tallies up the ones we care about.
  
  
The analytical method using Markov chain required too much mental gymnastics at the time.
This will be another one of those projects that I will probably never update unless my interest in it get's reignited
